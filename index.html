    <h1>D3 Layouts</h1>
    
    <h3>Murray prefaces the chapter with some important concepts concerning layouts in d3:
        <br><br>
        <q>Contrary to what the name implies, D3 <i>layouts</i> do not, in fact, lay anything out for you on the screen. The layout methods have no direct <i>visual</i> output. Rather, the D3 layouts take the data that you provide and remap or otherwise transform it, thereby generating <i>new</i> data that is more convenient for a specific visual task. It's still up to you to take that new data and generate visuals from it.</q>
        <br><br>
        
        <div>
        The list of D3 layouts includes:<ul>
            
            <li>Chord</li>
            <li>Cluster</li>
            <li>Force</li>
            <li>Pack</li>
            <li>Partition</li>
            <li>Pie</li>
            <li>Stack</li>
            <li>Tree</li>
            <li>Treemap</li>
            
           
            
            
            
            </ul>
             </div>

        <h2>A common algorithmic way to use layouts:</h2>
        
        <h3>It seems there are three general steps to follow in using D3 layouts:
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Convert the data so that it can be used by the corresponding layout. This is different for each one, but this usually involves the use of a line of code that uses the layouts name, such as <span class="code">d3.pie()</span> or <span class="code">d3.stack</span>, etc.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Create the visual elements characteristic of the layout. For pie charts, this means arcs, for stack layouts, rectangles, etc.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Add the finishing touches, depending on the layout. This can come in the form of ordering the data or updating it over time, to name a few examples.</h4></li>
        </ol></h3>
